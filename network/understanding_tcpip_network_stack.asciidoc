== Key Charasteristics of TCP/IP

. Connection-oriented
. Bidirectional Byte Stream
. In-order Delivery
. Reliability through ACK
. Flow Control
. Congestion Control

== Data Transmission

.Operation process by each layer of TCP/IP network stack for data transmission
image::data_transmission_1.png[]
Layers classified into three areas:
. User area
. Kernel area
. Device area
Tasks at the user area and the kernel area are performed by the CPU, called *host*. _Network Interface Card_ (NIC) is to handle device area.
